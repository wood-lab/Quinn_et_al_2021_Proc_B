Code associated with Quinn et al. 2021. "Long-term change in the parasite burden of shore crabs (Hemigrapsus oregonensis and H. nudus) on the northwestern Pacific coast of North America." Proceedings of the Royal Society B.

This code refers to several datasets: (1) dataset on the abundance of three parasite taxa in the shore crabs Hemigrapsus oregonensis and H. nudus (raw_data.csv), which includes both historical (1969-1970) and contemporary (2018-2020) data collected from intertidal sites between Oregon and British Columbia, (2) a meta-data file that explains the column names for each column in raw_data.csv (raw_data_metadata.csv), (3) dataset from an experiment we performed to test the effect of freezing on parasite detectability, containing the abundance of three parasite taxa in crabs that were either frozen immediately before dissection or dissected fresh (experiment_data.csv), and (4) latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates for each of our sampling sites (site_coords.csv).

Note that we have made scans of the original paper datasheets from the historical (1969-1970) sampling campaign available on Dryad (see information below).

Data are available in this repository, and are also permanently archived in Dryad:
